# elf_diff - A Tool to compare elf binaries

## A Brief Introduction

This tool compares pairs of ELF binary files and provides information about differences in the contained symbols with respect to the space that they occupy in program memory (functions and global data) and in RAM (global data). Binary pairs that are passed to _elf_diff_ are typically two versions of the same program/library/firmware. _elf_diff_ can help you to find out about the impact of your changes on your code's resource consumption.

The differences between the binaries are summarized in tables that contain information about persistent, disappeared and new symbols. _elf_diff_ also attempts to find pairs of matching symbols that might have been subject to renaming or signature changes (modified function arguments). Please be warned that the means to determine such symbol relations are very limited when working with binaries. False positives will result.

For all those symbols that have been subject to changes and also for the new and disappeared symbols, the tool provides diff-like comparisons of the disassembly.

All results are presented in either HTML or pdf files. HTML documents are cross-linked to conveniently allow jumping back and forth between bits of information, e.g. tabular information and symbol disassemblies. Du to the potentially large amount of information, some parts of the HTML reports are ommitted in the pdf files.

_elf_diff_ has two modes of operation, pair-reports and mass-reports. While the former compares two binaries, the latter generates an overview-report for a set of binary-pairs. Such overview-reports list only the changes in terms of symbol sizes and the amount of symbols, no disassembly is provided to gain feasible document sizes.

## Requirements

_elf_diff_ is a Python script. It mostly uses standard libraries but also some non-standard packages (see the file `python/requirements.txt`) for more information.

elf_diff works and is automatically tested with Python 2 and 3.

## Setup

The following procedure is required to setup _elf_diff_.

1. Install Python version >= 2.7
2. Clone the [_elf_diff_](https://github.com/CapeLeidokos/_elf_diff_) repo from github.
3. Run `make` from within the _elf_diff_ repo or directly install required packages
via pip as `pip install -r python/requirements.txt`
4. Add the `bin` directory of the _elf_diff_ repo to your platform search path

## Usage

Information about _elf_diff_'s command line flags can be obtained by running
```
elf_diff -h
```

### Generating Pair-Reports

To generate a pair report, two binary files need to be passed to _elf_diff_ via the command line. Let's assume those files are named `my_old_binary.elf` and `my_new_binary.elf`. 

The following command will generate a html report file named `elf_diff_pair_report.html` in your current working directory.
```
elf_diff my_old_binary.elf my_new_binary.elf
```

### Generating Mass-Reports

Mass reports require a driver file (yaml syntax) that specifies a list of binaries to compare pair-wise. 

Let's assume you have two pairs of binaries that reside in a directory `/home/my_user`.
```
binary_a_old.elf <-> binary_a_new.elf
binary_b_old.elf <-> binary_b_new.elf
```

A driver file (named `my_elf_diff_driver.yaml`) would then contain the following information:
```
binary_pairs:
    - old_binary: "/home/my_user/binary_a_old.elf"
      new_binary: "/home/my_user/binary_a_new.elf"
      short_name: "A short name"
    - old_binary: "/home/my_user/binary_b_old.elf"
      new_binary: "/home/my_user/binary_b_new.elf"
      short_name: "B short name"
```

The `short_name` parameters are used in the result tables to reference the respective binary pairs.

By using the driver file, we can now run a mass-report as 
```
elf_diff --mass_report --driver_file my_elf_diff_driver.yaml
```

This will generate a HTML file `elf_diff_mass_report.html` in your current working directory.

### Generating pdf-Files

pdf files are generated by supplying the output file name using the parameter `pdf_file` either at the command line 

```
elf_diff --pdf_file my_pair_report.pdf my_old_binary.elf my_new_binary.elf
```
or from within a driver file, e.g.
```
pdf_file: "my_pair_report.pdf"
```

### Specifying an Alternative HTML File Location

Similar to specifying an explicit filename for pdf files, the same can be done for our HTML output files, either via the command line
```
elf_diff --html_file my_pair_report.hmtl my_old_binary.elf my_new_binary.elf
```
or from within a driver file, e.g.
```
html_file: "my_pair_report.html"
```

### Using Driver Files

The driver files that we already met when generating mass-reports can also generally be used to run _elf_diff_. Any parameters that can be passed as command line arguments to _elf_diff_ can also occur in a driver file, e.g.
```
elf_diff --mass_report --pdf_file my_file.pdf ...
```
In `my_elf_diff_driver.yaml`
```
mass_report: True
pdf_file: my_file.pdf
...
```
### Supplying a Project Title

A project title could e.g. be a short name that summarizes the changes that you applied between the old and the new version of the compared binaries. Supply a title via the parameter `project_title`.

### Adding Background Information

Additional information about the compared binaries can be added to pair-reports. Use the parameters `old_info_file` and `new_info_file` to supply filenames of text files whose content is supposed to be added to the report.

It is also possible to add general information to reports, e.g. about programming language or compiler version or about the build-system. This is supported through the `build_info` parameter which enables supplying a string that is added to the report. For longer strings, this can be conveniently done via the driver-file.

Everything that follows after `build_info: >` in the example will be added to the report.
```
build_info: >
  This build
  info is added to the report.
  The whitespaces in front of these lines are removed, the line breaks are
  preserved.
```

### Using Alias Strings

If you want to obtain anonymized reports, it is not desirable to reveile details about your user name (home directory) or the directory structure. In such a case, the binary filenames can be replaced by alias wherever they would appear in the reports. 

Supply alias names using the `old_alias` and `new_alias` parameters for the old or the new version of the binaries, respectively.

### Working with Cross-Build Binaries

When working on firmware projects for embedded devices, you typically will be using a cross-build environment. If based on GNU gcc, such an environment usually not only ships with the necessary compilers but also with a set of additional tools called [GNU Binutils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Binutils).

_elf_diff_ uses some of these tools to inspect binaries, namely `nm`, `objdump` and `size`. Although some information about binaries can be determined even with the host-version of these tools, it is e.g. not possible to retreive disassemblies.

In a cross-build environment, Binutils executable are usually bundled in a specific directory. They also often have a platform-specific prefix, to make them distinguishabel from their host-platform siblings. For the [avr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVR_microcontrollers)-version of Binutils e.g., that is shipped with the [Arduino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino) development suite, the prefix `avr-` is used. The respective commands are, thus, named `avr-nm`, `avr-objdump` and `avr-size`.

To make those dedicated binaries known to _elf_diff_, please use the parameters `bin_dir` and `bin_prefix`.

A pair-report generation command for the avr-plattform would e.g. read

```
elf_diff --bin_dir <path_to_avr_binaries> --bin_prefix "avr-" my_old_binary.elf my_new_binary.elf
```
The string `<path_to_avr_binaries>` in the above example would of course be replaced by the actual directory path where the binaries live.

### Generating a Template Driver File

To generate a template driver file that can serve as a basis for your own
driver files, just run _elf_diff_ with the `driver_template_file` parameter, e.g. as
```
elf_diff --driver_template_file my_template.yaml
```

Template files contain the default values of all available parameters, or - if the temple file is generated in the same session where a report was created - the template file will contain the actual settings used for the report generation.

### Text Output

Early versions of this tool supported text output instead of HTML or pdf files. Text output has been removed as it is simple to generate text representations of HTML tables using external tools. Most GNU/Linux distributions e.g. ship with a tool called `html2text` that is well suited to do the job.
